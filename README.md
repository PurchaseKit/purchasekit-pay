# PurchaseKit::Pay

PurchaseKit payment processor for the [Pay gem](https://github.com/pay-rails/pay).

Add mobile in-app purchases (IAP) to your Rails app with PurchaseKit and Pay.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "purchasekit-pay"
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle install
```

## Configuration

Configure your PurchaseKit API key:

```ruby
# config/initializers/purchasekit.rb
PurchaseKit::Pay.configure do |config|
  config.api_key = Rails.application.credentials.dig(:purchasekit, :api_key)
  config.webhook_secret = Rails.application.credentials.dig(:purchasekit, :webhook_secret)
end
```

Mount the engine in your routes:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
mount PurchaseKit::Pay::Engine, at: "/purchasekit"
```

### JavaScript setup

Import the Turbo Stream actions in your application:

```javascript
// app/javascript/application.js
import "purchasekit-pay/turbo_actions"
```

Register the gem's Stimulus controllers:

```javascript
// app/javascript/controllers/index.js
import { application } from "controllers/application"
import { eagerLoadControllersFrom } from "@hotwired/stimulus-loading"

eagerLoadControllersFrom("controllers", application)
eagerLoadControllersFrom("purchasekit-pay", application)
```

## Usage

### Adding a paywall

First, ensure your user has a PurchaseKit payment processor:

```ruby
current_user.set_payment_processor(:purchasekit)
```

Then render a paywall using the builder pattern:

```erb
<%# Subscribe to ActionCable for real-time redirect after purchase %>
<%= turbo_stream_from dom_id(Current.user.payment_processor) %>

<%= purchasekit_paywall customer: Current.user.payment_processor, success_path: dashboard_path do |paywall| %>
  <%# Plan options with radio buttons %>
  <%= paywall.plan_option store_product_id: "com.example.annual", selected: true do %>
    <span>Annual</span>
    <%= paywall.price store_product_id: "com.example.annual" %>
  <% end %>

  <%= paywall.plan_option store_product_id: "com.example.monthly" do %>
    <span>Monthly</span>
    <%= paywall.price store_product_id: "com.example.monthly" %>
  <% end %>

  <%# Submit button %>
  <%= paywall.submit "Subscribe", class: "btn btn-primary" %>

  <%# Restore purchases link %>
  <%= paywall.restore_link %>
<% end %>
```

### Paywall helper options

- `customer:` (required) - A `Pay::Customer` instance
- `success_path:` - Where to redirect after successful purchase (defaults to `root_path`)

### Builder methods

- `plan_option(store_product_id:, selected: false)` - Radio button for a plan
- `price(store_product_id:)` - Displays the localized price (fetched from native app)
- `submit(text)` - Submit button (disabled until prices load)
- `restore_link(text: "Restore purchases")` - Link to restore previous purchases

### How it works

1. Page loads, Stimulus controller requests prices from native app via Hotwire Native Bridge
2. User selects a plan and taps subscribe
3. Form submits to PurchasesController, which creates a purchase intent with the SaaS
4. Native app handles the App Store/Play Store purchase flow
5. SaaS receives webhook from Apple/Google, normalizes it, and POSTs to your app
6. Webhook handler creates `Pay::Subscription` and broadcasts a Turbo Stream redirect
7. User is redirected to `success_path`

## Webhook events

The gem handles these webhook events from the PurchaseKit SaaS:

- `subscription.created` - Creates a new `Pay::Subscription`
- `subscription.updated` - Updates subscription status and period
- `subscription.canceled` - Marks subscription as canceled
- `subscription.expired` - Marks subscription as expired

## Requirements

- Rails 7.0+
- Pay 11.0+
- Turbo Rails (for ActionCable broadcasts)
- Stimulus
- Hotwire Native app with PurchaseKit bridge component

### JavaScript dependencies

This gem vendors and pins:

- **@hotwired/hotwire-native-bridge** (v1.2.2)

If your app already pins this package, your version takes precedence.
