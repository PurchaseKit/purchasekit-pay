# purchasekit-pay gem

Pay gem integration for in-app purchases.

## Configuration

### Production mode

```ruby
PurchaseKit::Pay.configure do |config|
  config.api_url = Rails.application.credentials.purchasekit[:api_url]
  config.api_key = Rails.application.credentials.purchasekit[:api_key]
  config.app_id = Rails.application.credentials.purchasekit[:app_id]
  config.webhook_secret = Rails.application.credentials.purchasekit[:webhook_secret]
end
```

**Note:** `webhook_secret` is required in production. Webhooks without a valid signature will be rejected. In development/test, signature verification is skipped if the secret is blank.

### Demo mode

Demo mode enables local development without a PurchaseKit account. Products are defined locally and purchases complete without API calls. Designed for use with Xcode's StoreKit local testing.

```ruby
PurchaseKit::Pay.configure do |config|
  config.demo_mode = true
  config.demo_products = {
    "annual" => { apple_product_id: "com.example.pro.annual" },
    "monthly" => { apple_product_id: "com.example.pro.monthly" }
  }
end
```

In demo mode:
- `Product.find` delegates to `Product::Demo` (reads from config) instead of `Product::Remote` (API call)
- `Purchase::Intent.create` delegates to `Intent::Demo` (in-memory store) instead of `Intent::Remote` (API call)
- The iOS app's Xcode completion callback POSTs directly to the local Rails app
- The completions controller creates a `Pay::Subscription` and broadcasts a Turbo Stream redirect

## Architecture

The gem acts as a bridge between:
1. **Rails app** - Renders paywall, handles webhooks, manages subscriptions
2. **PurchaseKit SaaS** - Normalizes Apple/Google webhooks, manages products and purchase intents
3. **Native app** - Handles App Store/Play Store purchase flow via Hotwire Native Bridge

## Product API

Fetch products from the SaaS API:

```ruby
@product = PurchaseKit::Product.find("prod_XXXXX")
@product.id                 # => "prod_XXXXX"
@product.apple_product_id   # => "com.example.pro.annual"
@product.google_product_id  # => "pro_annual"
```

Products are configured in the SaaS dashboard. The gem fetches them via the API at `/api/v1/apps/:app_id/products/:id`.

## Purchase::Intent API

Create a purchase intent before triggering the native purchase:

```ruby
intent = PurchaseKit::Purchase::Intent.create(
  product_id: "prod_XXXXX",
  customer_id: customer.id,
  success_path: "/paid",
  environment: "sandbox"
)

intent.id       # => "pi_QCCWGR8F"
intent.uuid     # => "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000" (for Apple correlation)
intent.product  # => PurchaseKit::Product
```

## Data flow

```
User taps Subscribe
    -> Form submits to PurchasesController
    -> Creates Purchase::Intent with SaaS API
    -> Returns UUID and product IDs to native app via Turbo Stream
    -> Native app triggers App Store purchase with UUID as appAccountToken
    -> Apple sends webhook to SaaS with UUID
    -> SaaS looks up intent, forwards normalized webhook to Rails app
    -> Webhook handler creates Pay::Subscription
    -> Broadcasts Turbo Stream redirect via ActionCable
    -> User redirected to success_path
```

## Engine setup

The engine (`lib/purchasekit/pay/engine.rb`) handles:

1. **Processor registration** - Adds `:purchasekit` to `Pay.enabled_processors`
2. **Webhook handlers** - Calls `Pay::Purchasekit.configure_webhooks` to register handlers
3. **Importmap** - Adds gem's JavaScript (turbo_actions, controllers) to app's importmap
4. **Helpers** - Makes `PaywallHelper` available in views

## Pay STI integration

Pay uses Single Table Inheritance (STI) via a `type` column. The gem defines processor-specific subclasses:

- `Pay::Purchasekit::Customer` - Raises errors for unsupported operations (`charge`, `subscribe`, `add_payment_method`)
- `Pay::Purchasekit::Subscription` - Raises errors for store-managed operations (`cancel`, `pause`, `resume`, `swap`)
- `Pay::Purchasekit::Charge` - Raises errors for `refund!` (must use App Store Connect / Play Console)

Webhook handlers create records via the subclass (e.g., `Pay::Purchasekit::Subscription.find_or_initialize_by`) to ensure the `type` column is set correctly. This allows Rails STI to instantiate the correct subclass when loading records.

## Webhook handlers

Registered in `lib/pay/purchasekit.rb` via `Pay::Webhooks.configure`:

- `purchasekit.subscription.created` → Creates `Pay::Purchasekit::Subscription`, broadcasts redirect
- `purchasekit.subscription.updated` → Updates status and period dates, optionally broadcasts redirect
- `purchasekit.subscription.canceled` → Sets status to canceled
- `purchasekit.subscription.expired` → Sets status to expired

Webhook queueing logic lives in `PurchaseKit::Pay::Webhook` (extracted from controller for cleaner architecture).

## JavaScript

- `purchasekit_pay/turbo_actions.js` - Custom `redirect` Turbo Stream action
- `purchasekit_pay/paywall_controller.js` - Handles native bridge communication

Host app must import: `import "purchasekit-pay/turbo_actions"`

The paywall controller:
- Sends both `appleStoreProductId` and `googleStoreProductId` to the native bridge
- Receives `environment` from native bridge's `prices` response and stores it in a hidden field
- Passes environment through to SaaS when creating purchase intent
- Shows spinner on submit button while processing (via `data-processing-text` attribute)

## Polymorphic class structure

`Product` and `Intent` use polymorphic subclasses for demo vs production behavior:

```
Product.find        → Product::Demo or Product::Remote
Intent.create       → Intent::Demo or Intent::Remote
```

Each base class owns its `demo_mode?` dispatch internally. Subclasses live in nested directories:

```
lib/purchasekit/
├── product.rb
├── product/
│   ├── demo.rb
│   └── remote.rb
└── purchase/
    ├── intent.rb
    └── intent/
        ├── demo.rb
        └── remote.rb
```

## Key decisions

- SaaS normalizes Apple/Google payloads (gem never sees raw data)
- Uses Pay gem's webhook infrastructure (`Pay::Webhooks.delegator`)
- Real-time UI updates via Turbo Streams over ActionCable
- `success_path` passed through SaaS in webhook payload (no Rails.cache)
- ActionCable `async` adapter won't work for console testing (in-memory only)
- Products fetched from SaaS API; display text (name, description) lives in the view for i18n support
- Polymorphism over conditionals: each class owns its demo/remote dispatch

## Testing

Run tests with:

```bash
bundle exec rake test
```

Tests use:
- **VCR** for HTTP request recording/replay (cassettes in `test/fixtures/vcr_cassettes/`)
- **Fixtures** for Pay::Customer and Pay::Subscription models
- **Dummy Rails app** in `test/dummy/` for integration testing

When adding new API tests, VCR cassettes should filter sensitive data (`<API_KEY>`, `<API_URL>`).

## Error classes

Custom errors are in `PurchaseKit::Pay` namespace:
- `PurchaseKit::Pay::Error` - Base error (inherits from `Pay::Error`)
- `PurchaseKit::Pay::NotFoundError` - 404 responses
- `PurchaseKit::Pay::SubscriptionRequiredError` - 402 responses (production requires subscription)
